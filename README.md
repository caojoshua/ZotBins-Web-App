## About
This is the first iteration of the webapp and was intended to encompass features for all ZotBins users. As of October 2019, we have 
decided to to split the web app into facilities management targeted web app, and a general user (students, faculty, etc) targeted
mobile app.  

Management app: https://github.com/zotbins/zotbins-management  
Android app: https://github.com/zotbins/zotbins-mobile-app-android  

The front-end interface is functional, so feel free to play around the app and play with the code. Be aware there are probably a million
bugs and the API calls are likely all dead.
